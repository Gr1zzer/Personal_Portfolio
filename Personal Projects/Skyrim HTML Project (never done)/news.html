        <h2>What is this site you might ask?</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to join the website fill the fields so you can help the webpage grow! Your help will give others information to keep playing
          the eternal game serise The Elder Scrolls. Tho this looks like a simple website I am working on keeping it updated and would love to
          see it grow into what I would imagine as the Gaming Wiki. If this comes true then I would have fulfilled my childhood goal to make
          something anyone can dive into and be happy. And no matter if it's a game or a mod for it I want this site to help anyone for anything.

      <h2>It's a me, Merlin the magic Wizard Lizard</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the magical world of Tameriel! Where you can make almost any choice you want. Just be carful of the chickens and children,
        for no reason chickens give you a bounty and children are immortal. But other than that you can do most things. Want to steal from
        one of the royal families around the land? You can go ahead, just becarful. You want to follow one of the many religeous figures like
        Talos or even Stendar? Go ahead, just don't tell the Thalmor. You want to murder a family run away to your custom built house given to you
        by the same royal family your sacked and stole from? Why did you do something so specific, but yes just don't get caught. Okay okay you
        get it, but seriously you can do pretty much anything. But "I have already done everything," and that is where you are WRONG there is a
        way you can get 1 or more of the DLCs (not Hearthfire unless you like families and houses). This includes 2 knew "Main Quests" for you to
        take on and 2 knew bosses to defeat. Be a one trick poney or become a jack of all traits. If you finished those and you get bored replaying
        do I have the solution for you. Mods can drastically make your gameplay experience or like some people very very chaotic. But I am just
        going to talk about base and DLC not mods. If you like great story than you will love the Elder Scrolls. Most stories will interconnect.
        There are even plenty of books for you to read if you like books. If you don't want to read books and you want adventures then great go for
        it. Want to be a leader of a guild or all of the guilds, welp you can. So have you wanted to find a game with tons of secrets or a story that
        all relates with each of the installments? Install Skyrim and Oblivion, and experience all the secrets yourself. Well if you have questions
        I will try responding to the questions to the best of my abilities. And if it all works out this page will help you as well. And we can hopfully
        have eachother out and give tips.
