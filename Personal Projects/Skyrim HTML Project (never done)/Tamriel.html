        <h2>It's a me, Merlin the magic Wizard Lizard</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the magical world of Tameriel! Well for what I can cover
          right now may only be the providence of Skyrim, or better known as the
          "Home of the Nordic Race." As you can tell this website will focus on
          being a medium of the community, and the games. It is to help other
          players and fans of the game find help or fun within the game. There
          will hopfully be a place for those who discover new things can post up
          and people can check it out. There might be a place for tips or tricks
          that others will give out to help. You wanna highlight and give notice
          to a small, or a great mod you liked? Well I will try implimenting
          that so then the highest rated mod (SFW) will be given the chance of
          highlight, and maybe a place to see the rankings and all the
          previously sent mods. I want this to be a thriving community and we
          can't do it alone. So welcome to Tamriel, Home of all.

      <h2>What is this game?</h2>
      <p>
        Skyrim is an interactive RPG game that was made and sold by Bethesda
        Studios. You are the legendary Dragonborn who is destened to save the
        world of Tamriel from the world from the evil Alduin the World eater. In
        your quest you will delve into dungons, fight bandits, maybe steal a few
        items here or there, and obviously our main-ish enemy is DRAGONS! Okay
        now that you know the main mission that you are up against you should
        know the other things you can do in the world of Skyrim. You can join
        the Thieve's Guild, The legendary Dark Brotherhood, go beyond and become
        a home owner or parent, and you can become a thane to the leaders or
        known as Jarls. But fair warning before you jump into such a fun and
        expansive game, don't let those pesky dragons stop you in your journey
        and adventures.
