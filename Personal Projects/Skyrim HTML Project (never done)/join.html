        <h2>What is this site you might ask?</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to join the website fill the fields so you can help the
          webpage grow! Your help will give others information to keep playing
          the eternal game serise The Elder Scrolls. Tho this looks like a
          simple website I am working on keeping it updated and would love to
          see it grow into what I would imagine as the Gaming Wiki. If this
          comes true then I would have fulfilled my childhood goal to make
          something anyone can dive into and be happy. And no matter if it's a
          game or a mod for it I want this site to help anyone for anything.
